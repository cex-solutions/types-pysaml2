# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by black:
#       E301 expected 1 blank line
#       E302 expected 2 blank lines
#       E305 expected 2 blank lines
#       E501 line too long

# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#       E701, E704 multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#       F401 imported but unused -- does not recognize re-exports
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/474
#       F822 undefined name in __all__ -- flake8 does not recognize 'foo: Any'
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/533

# Rules that are out of the control of stub authors:
#       E741 ambiguous variable name
#       F403 import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#       F405 defined from star imports

# Rules from flake8-pyi that enforce PEP 604/585 style:
#       Y022 Use "collections.abc.X" instead of "typing.X"
#       Y037 Use PEP 604 union types (X | Y instead of Union[X, Y])
#       Y090 Tuple type hints suggestions
